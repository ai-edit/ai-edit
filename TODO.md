# AI-Edit Implementation TODO (Re-verified)

## Verification Report (Automated Check ‚Äì 2024-06-12)

During the latest automated scan almost all tasks marked as completed **are indeed implemented**
(see detailed notes below).
One discrepancy was detected and has been corrected in this file.

‚úÖ = Confirmed implemented
‚ùå = Missing / incomplete implementation

1. ‚úÖ **Phase 3 ‚Üí Change Application Engine ‚Üí Step 4 (CLI / Orchestration)**
   ‚Ä¢ `ai_edit/cli.py` correctly inspects `kind == "diff"` from
     `parse_ai_response(...)` and routes the payload to
     `file_manager.apply_patch(...)`.
   ‚Ä¢ Verified in the final write-loop (`for op in final_operations:`).

2. ‚ùå **Phase 3 ‚Üí Response Processing ‚Üí Error Recovery**
   ‚Ä¢ `ai_edit/utils/parser.py` successfully parses regular and diff code blocks.
   ‚Ä¢ However, there is **no explicit error-recovery logic** for malformed /
     ambiguous AI responses (e.g. unclosed fences, truncated XML) ‚Äì the current
     implementation silently skips such fragments rather than attempting to
     repair or notify.

_All other items previously marked as completed were verified and found to be
implemented correctly._

## Running the Test Suite

The repository contains three main test modules located in the `tests/`
directory:

* `tests/test_cli.py` ‚Äì validates CLI behaviour and user interaction.
* `tests/test_config.py` ‚Äì covers configuration management logic.
* `tests/test_diff.py` ‚Äì unit and integration tests for diff generation /
  application and the `FileManager` patch workflow.

### Quick start

# 1. (Optional) create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate          # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# 2. Install ai-edit with development dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# 3. Run the whole test suite
pytest

### Extra options

# Run tests with minimal output
pytest -q

# Measure test coverage
pytest --cov=ai_edit --cov-report=term-missing

---

## Phase 1: Project Foundation ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] Set up Python package structure.
- [x] Basic CLI Framework with `init`, `config`, and `status` commands.
- [x] Configuration Management using `.ai-edit.yaml` and environment variables.

## Phase 2: Core Infrastructure ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] Azure OpenAI Integration with `ai_edit/core/ai_client.py`.
- [x] Repository Context Building with `ai_edit/core/context.py`, respecting `.gitignore`.
- [x] File Management System with `ai_edit/core/file_manager.py` for safe reads, writes, and backups.

## ------------------ CURRENT DEVELOPMENT FOCUS ------------------

## Phase 3: AI Processing Pipeline üü° PARTIALLY COMPLETED
*A functional baseline exists. Remaining tasks focus on improving precision and robustness.*

- [p] **Change Application Engine**
  - [x] Apply full file content changes.
  - [x] Implement `diff` generation and application for more precise, partial file updates.
    Detailed implementation plan:
      1. `ai_edit/utils/diff.py` ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
      2. `ai_edit/core/file_manager.py` ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
      3. `ai_edit/utils/parser.py` ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
      4. `ai_edit/cli.py` ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
      5. Tests (`tests/test_diff.py`) ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
      6. Optional: Config flag (`.ai-edit.yaml`) ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
  - [ ] Add strategies to preserve existing code formatting and style where possible.

- [p] **Response Processing**
  - [x] Create `ai_edit/utils/parser.py` to parse AI responses for file operations.
  - [x] Extract full file paths and content from fenced code blocks.
  - [ ] Implement error recovery for malformed or ambiguous AI responses.  <!-- corrected from done -->

- [p] **Prompt Engineering**
  - [x] Create context injection templates from external files.
  - [ ] Design specialized prompts for different request types (add, modify, refactor, fix).
  - [ ] Implement few-shot examples in prompts to improve AI accuracy.

## Phase 4: Safety and Validation
*Crucial for user trust and multi-language support.*
- [p] **Core Safety Features**
  - [x] Implement `--dry-run`, `--interactive`, and `--backup` flags in the CLI.
  - [ ] Create `ai_edit/utils/git.py` for automated Git operations.
  - [ ] Automatically create a Git commit before applying changes.
  - [ ] Implement a `rollback` command to revert the last set of changes.
- [ ] **Configurable Validation Engine (NEW)**
  - [ ] Add a `validation_command` (e.g., `make`, `npm test`, `swift build`) to `.ai-edit.yaml`.
  - [ ] After applying changes, automatically run the specified validation command.
  - [ ] Capture the `stdout` and `stderr` from the command.
- [ ] **AI Feedback Loop (NEW)**
  - [ ] If the validation command fails, feed the compiler/linker errors back to the AI.
  - [ ] Use a new prompt template asking the AI to fix the errors based on the feedback.
  - [ ] Re-apply the new, corrected changes from the AI.

## ------------------ NEXT PRIORITIES ------------------

## Phase 5: Advanced Features
- [ ] **Multi-step Operations**
  - [ ] Break complex changes into sequential steps with user confirmation.
- [ ] **Interactive Mode Enhancements**
  - [ ] Implement a conversational interface for clarification questions.

## Phase 6: Testing and Quality
- [ ] **Unit and Integration Testing**
  - [ ] Set up `pytest` framework and write tests for all core components (AI client, parser, file manager).
  - [ ] Create end-to-end tests for common use cases in different languages.
- [p] **Code Quality**
  - [x] Set up pre-commit hooks with `black`, `flake8`, `isort`, `mypy`.

## ------------------ FUTURE VISION ------------------

## Phase 7: User Experience
- [ ] **CLI Enhancements**
  - [ ] Add progress indicators for long operations.
  - [ ] Improve output formatting and color with `rich`.
  - [ ] Add support for shell auto-completion.
- [ ] **Documentation**
  - [ ] Update README with real, multi-language examples.
  - [ ] Create a comprehensive usage and configuration guide.
  - [ ] Provide example projects for testing and demonstration.

## Phase 8: Distribution
- [ ] **Package Distribution**
  - [ ] Prepare for PyPI release.
  - [ ] Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD to automate testing and releases.
- [ ] **Installation Methods**
  - [ ] Create a Homebrew formula for macOS users.
  - [ ] Publish a Docker image for containerized use.

## Phase 9: Advanced Integrations
- [ ] **Additional AI Providers**

  - [ ] Add support for the official OpenAI API, Anthropic Claude, and local models via Ollama.
- [ ] **IDE Integration**
  - [ ] Plan and develop a VS Code extension or JetBrains plugin.
- [ ] **Collaboration Features**
