## Current Priority Order
1. **Phase 1** - Get basic project structure and CLI working
2. **Phase 2** - Core infrastructure for AI and file handling
3. **Phase 3** - Basic AI processing pipeline
4. **Phase 4** - Safety features (crucial for user trust)
5. **Phase 5+** - Advanced features and polish

## Success Metrics
- [ ] Can initialize in any Git repository
- [ ] Can make simple code changes via natural language
- [ ] Changes are safe and can be rolled back
- [ ] Works reliably with Azure OpenAI
- [ ] Good performance on medium-sized codebases (< 1000 files)
- [ ] Clear error messages and user feedback

## Notes
- Focus on MVP first - get basic functionality working
- Prioritize safety and reliability over features
- Test with real projects early and often
- Document everything as you build
- Get user feedback as soon as basic version works
