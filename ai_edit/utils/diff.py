ai_edit.utils.diff
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Utility helpers for generating and applying unified diffs.

The main purpose of this module is to let the AI-Edit engine work with
partial file updates instead of having to replace the entire file
content.  `generate_diff` can be used by tests (and later by the CLI) to
create a unified diff, while `apply_diff` turns such a diff back into its
patched form.

The implementation purposefully avoids external dependencies so that the
core package remains lightweight and self-contained.
